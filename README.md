  <strong>OWL Control</strong> is a desktop application that records gameplay footage and input data from video games<br/>
  to create open-source datasets for AI research. By using OWL Control,<br/>
  you're contributing to the development of AI agents and world models.

## 🎮 What is OWL Control?

OWL Control records your gameplay sessions (video + keyboard/mouse inputs) from games, using OBS to do the recording work. This data can be uploaded to create a public dataset that researchers worldwide can use to train AI models.

**[The games list](./GAMES.md)** is a list of the games we're most actively seeking data for. Other first- and third-person games are acceptable, but check in with us if possible.

**DISCLAIMER**: THERE ARE REPORTS OF OWL CONTROL CAUSING BANS IN MULTIPLAYER PVP GAMES - WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND USING ONLY IN SINGLE-PLAYER GAMES

## 🚀 Getting Started (User Installation)
The below text is supplemental, please watch the video tutorial here:  
[link](https://www.loom.com/share/f18451c8196a47a9a2dd7418f785cd37)  
The video goes over common failure cases and shows some light debugging. OWL Control is currently in pre-release and there a lot of kinks to iron out. As such the video tutorial is extensive,
and features some minor debugging. It should be watched in full before you use the software so you can both verify it is working and report correctly when it is not.

<td><strong>Once OWL Control is open, you should give it around ~5 minutes to ensure it has time to install all python packages. After that, you can start gaming!</strong> Recordings are currently manually initiated; when in any fullscreen game, hit F4 to start recording, and F5 to stop (by default). You can test it is running my pressing F4 outside of a game, which should give you a windows notification saying that OWL Control will not record with no foreground fullscreen application.</td>

## 🛡️ Risks And Additional Information

- **Audio**: OWL control does not record microphone inputs. It records game audio only, not all system audio.  
- **Accidental Recording**: We have observed a bug where sometimes OWL control responds to F4 (the default record button, which can be accidentally activated if one alt-f4s a game to close it) right after you close a game. In cases where this happens, it can be a good idea to quickly double check OBS after you close a game. Black recordings that result from this will be filtered out of the uploaded dataset but might still upload.  
- **Processing**: All data will undergo an automated vetting process to ensure we aren't using any empty recordings. That being said, OWL Control specifically sets OBS to record full screen applications, so there is no risk of accidental desktop capture.  
- **Data Verification**: You can press "file -> show recordings" in OBS if you want to verify your data is recording properly before upload.  

## 💻 System Requirements

An NVIDIA GPU is reccomended. You should set your preset in OBS to NVENC with P7 otherwise you may get lag. AMD GPUs should have an equivalent.  
Video upload can be bandwidth intensive, though we downsample videos to 360p and set an appropriate bitrate to lighten the load as much as possible.   

## ⚙️ Uploading  

Uploads are manual only. Data is stored locally and only uploaded when you manually press the upload button in settings. You can access upload options by opening the tray icon and selecting "Settings" -> "Upload". Note that you can always press "show recordings" in OBS to find all the files.

## ⌨️ Default Hotkeys

<div align="center">

| Key/Action | Function |
|:----------:|:---------|
| **F4** | 🟢 Start recording manually |
| **F5** | 🔴 Stop recording |
| **System Tray Icon** | ⚙️ Access settings and controls |

Hotkeys for record/stop record can be changed in the applications settings.

## 💻 For Developers

> **OWL Control is open source!** If you're interested in the technical details or want to contribute:

### 🔨 Building from Source  

First make sure you've installed Node, UV, and Rust (Cargo). It is reccomended to use powershell, and windows developer tools for this.  
Winget can sometimes make a lot of this easier for you, but online installers should work. If you have any issues with setup, ask your local LLM!

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Wayfarer-Labs/owl-control.git
cd owl-control

# Install dependencies
npm install
uv sync
.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1

# Build the application
cargo build --release --bin owl-recorder
npm run build

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Package for distribution (includes Python bundling)
npm run package:download-requirements # run this first
npm run package        # All platforms
npm run package:win    # Windows only
npm run package:mac    # macOS only
npm run package:linux  # Linux only
```

Currently only Windows is supported, although we'll be adding more platforms in the near future.
