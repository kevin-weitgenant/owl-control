# Games

We want data from these games first and foremost. Other first- and third-person games are acceptable, but check in with us if possible.

`FP` below refers to "first person". We are primarily looking for first-person data.

# Preferred Games

You may have heard that we are offering to buy games for people so long as they commit to getting us a significant amount of data from that game.

The caveat with this is that we are choosing which games to buy to control the data mixture. We will only buy _preferred games_. While you can use the list below as reference, this refers to games that are:

- First Person
- High Quality/Detail (Need not be AAA/new, i.e. Crysis 3)
- Action Packed (Doesn't need to be fighting, just lots of events happening beyond moving/looking around)

If you would like a game that fits these criteria and are willing to collect data for it, let us know and we can get you a key!

Note that not all games in the below list necessarily meet the above criteria, and that failing to meet this criteria does not make a game "bad data".
